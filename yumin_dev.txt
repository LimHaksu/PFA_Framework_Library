1. PFA Random Generation Function

INPUT : None
OUTPUT : PFA

at = PFA(nbL, nbS, initial, final, transitions)
==> The alphabets are small case english alphabets. therefore nbL is 26
==> nbS is a random number in 10 ~ 2000

- Initial probabilities
sum_to_one(nbS)

- Final probabilities & Transition probabilities
sum_to_one(1 + ?)
? is a random number in (0 ~ nbS*nbL)

cartesian product (alphabets, states) ==> nbL * nbS
select a random number n from above list
sum_to_one



=> The sum of initial probabilities equals to 1
=> For each state, the sum of outgoing probabilities + final probability = 1
